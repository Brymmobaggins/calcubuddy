# Gotv loading page

## Process

I woke up in the middle of sunny sunday afternoon (16th of May 2021) and switch on my GOTV and tv set, whilst it was loading i had this thought i could clone/ redesigned the loading page to hone my frontend skill. I spent ridiculous amount of time on the styling Mobile view, we all know how css is capbale to render our life useless, at the same time it fun.

futhermore, i created a script file to get my hands dirty on the Javascript. It was pretty logic as usual and i was skeptical on how i could name the function 'Move()' or 'load()', i decided to seat on 'Move' because i love the fact it simply means "going forward" which was self explanatory.
