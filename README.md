# Gotv loading page

![Project image](./img/gotvProjects_screenshot.png)


## Process

I woke up in the middle of sunny sunday afternoon (16th of May 2021) and switched on my GOTV and tv set, whilst it was loading i had this thought i could clone/ redesigned the loading page to hone my frontend skill. I spent ridiculous amount of time on the styling Mobile view, we all know how CSS is capable to render our life useless, at the same time fun.

furthermore, I created a script file to get my hands dirty on the JavaScript. It was pretty confuse as usual and I was skeptical on how I could name the function 'Move()' or 'load()', I decided to sit on 'Move' because I love the fact it simply means going forward which is self explanatory.
